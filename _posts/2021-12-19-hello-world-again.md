So ya, about that...ðŸ˜¬

To the handful of automated web crawlers that actually read my blog, I'm sorry. I'll recap all the details soon, but suffice to say there were a lot of things happening and I lost the desire to write for you. Aside from the odd Goodreads review and occasional letter, I haven't done much *effortful* writing at all. Even my daily journal entries, which used to be so thoughtful and well-written, have started to suffer. Spending five minutes a day in my diary just isn't cutting it anymore. I have to start *writing* again.

But why does it have to be so difficult?! How can I love this process so much when I loathe its results? Why is it that so many others feel this way too?

I think it's because we, as authors, are the only ones fully aware of how disappointing our writing is. Even at their best, our words never do justice to the feelings we sought to express. They always end up feeling half-baked.

Personally, I struggle with letting the pursuit of perfect language distract me from the more important goal: communicating clearly. I'll start out wanting to share a really important thought or feeling and subsequently get stuck for hours on making some stupid transition sentence sound prettier. Would you believe me if I told you I rewrote this blog post three times? Because I did. At least this third draft doesn't make me physically cringe like the first two did.

So, all that is to say that I'm setting an intention to write more *and* write less: to make up for in quantity what I lose in "quality." And if I disappear for another two years...hopefully it'll be for a good reason again!

(Proof of life)
