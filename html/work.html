        <p>As a developer for this small software consultancy, I helped create and maintain over a dozen web applications serving a diverse array of clients. From state education departments, to European record labels, to inter-planetary space exploration companies, I delivered quality software to companies of all shapes and sizes.</p>
        <p>During my time at BNB, I acquired skills in all levels of our tech stack. The average day for me included anything from:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Implementing a front end redesign</li>
          <li>Writing tests to ensure a smooth upgrade of an old project</li>
          <li>Transitioning an app to a new deployment infrastructure (<a href="https://www.terraform.io/">üòçTerraformüòç</a>)</li>
          <li>Developing new and exciting tools for our clients!</li>
        </ul>
