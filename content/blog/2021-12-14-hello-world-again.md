So ya, about that...ðŸ˜¬

To the handful of automated web crawlers that actually read my blog, I'm sorry. In the face of major changes in both my personal life and the world at large, I completely lost the desire to write for you. Aside from the odd Goodreads review and occasional letter, I haven't done much *effortful* writing at all. Even my daily journal entries, which used to be so thoughtful and well-written, have started to suffer.Â 

I'm losing touch with one of my favorite hobbies, and five minutes a day of committing my horrifically embarrassing thoughts and feelings to paper just isn't cutting it anymore. I have to start *writing* again.

But why do I find it to be so difficult?! How can I love this process so much when I loathe its results? Why is it that so many others feel this way too?

I think it's because we are the only ones fully aware of how fundamentally disappointing our writing is. Even at their best, our words still only form the faintest outline of the ideas we sought to express. They can never be more than a second hand picture of the rich internal worlds we all inhabit.

But even with this great shortcoming, writing remains my favorite way of attaining clarity. It forces me to dig up, examine, challenge, and synthesize the ideas floating around in my head. It challenges me to *speak* *clearly,* something I am decidedly not good at. And most of all, it gives me the outlet to express myself in ways that I otherwise never would. It's liberating, and so very worth the effort of struggling with it.

My only commitment is to write *more.*

I'm alive!
